## Bogleheads Investment Philosophy

Inspired by the philosophy of John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, this repository includes dedicated folders for various Bogleheads-inspired portfolio strategies:
- **One Fund Portfolio:** A simple, yet effective strategy focusing on a single, well-diversified fund.
- **Two Fund Portfolio:** Balances a stock market index fund with a bond market index fund for risk management.
- **Three Fund Portfolio:** An extension of the two-fund strategy, adding international stocks for further diversification.

The essence of the Bogleheads investment philosophy, especially when it comes to low-cost index fund investing with total world stock market and bonds, is captured in the following principles:

- [ ] **Diversification:** Over 10,000 world-wide securities.
- [ ] **Contains Every Style and Cap-Size.**
- [ ] **Very Low Cost.**
- [ ] **Very Tax-Efficient.**
- [ ] **No Manager Risk.**
- [ ] **No Style Drift.**
- [ ] **No Overlap.**
- [ ] **Low Turnover.**
- [ ] **Avoids "Front Running."**
- [ ] **Easy to Rebalance.**
- [ ] **Never Under-Performs the Market (Less Worry).**
- [ ] **Mathematically Certain to Out-Perform Most Investors.**
- [ ] **Simplicity.**


Each folder will contain tools and scripts tailored to the specific strategy, helping users implement the Bogleheads philosophy according to their individual investment preferences and goals.
